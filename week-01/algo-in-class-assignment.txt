Given two numbers, write an algorithm that outputs the sum of all odd numbers between those numbers, inclusive.

number1 = 12
number2 = 5
sum = 0

if number1 > number2
		min = number2
		max = number1
	else
		min = number1
		max = number2
loop index = min, to max, step 1
	if index % 2 == 1
		sum = sum + index
end of loop

print sum
