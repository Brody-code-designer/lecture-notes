# Assignment: Technology portrayals in movies, television, and news media

As you're preparing to enter a career in technology, it's helpful to have a grasp of how others from other careers will see you.  Much of that is influenced by portrayals that people see in popular culture.

Your assignment is to find a piece of popular culture that mainly revolves around technology, watch or read it, and then come prepared to discuss it in class.  You can watch a movie OR at least 2 episodes of a television show OR spend at least 45 minutes reading longform articles or books.  When we come back to class, we will discuss what people saw.

As you're watching, think about the following questions
1. In the piece, who is/are the technology expert(s)?  What are their cultural traits?  What are their personal traits?  
2. Are technology experts shown in a positive or negative light?  Do you agree with the portrayal?
3. What does the piece say, either explicitly or implicitly, about what technology's role should be in society?  Do you agree?

You can choose any movie, television show, book, or longform articles you wish, as long as technology plays a major role.  Some suggestions are  below.
