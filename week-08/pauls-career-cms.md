# CMSes and Paul's career path

## My Story
* Learned some C++ in high school
* Went to college, learned Java as part of a four year degree in Computer Science
  * Not necessary for a career in this field
  * Can open doors for you, esp. later in your career
  * big sacrifice!  4 years, lots of debt 
  * with bootcamp background, much easier to go back and earn degree if you decide you need it.
* Got an internship at a bank, learned basics of IT
  * Was too much system admin for me, not enough development
* Freelanced for a bit as a DB Admin/Ruby on Rails developer
* Got a "real job" as an in-house web developer who babysat a production schedule for an manufacturing company
  * hated it, mostly because it was a bad culture fit
* Went back to freelancing as part of a small developer co-op, learned Drupal CMS
  * Got me into the agency world
  * Worked directly with clients
* Spent the rest of my career in the agency world growing from Junior Dev -> Senior Dev -> Team Lead
  * Switched companies frequently, average every 2-3 years
  * This is the norm for software development!  Best way to advance your career.
  * Don't get the same job at another company!  Focus on moves that allow you to specialize and fit you better.
* Lessons learned
  * Make sure that you have the resources available to take risks when opportunities present themselves
  * Your employer is not your friend.  They're a partner in a relationship, and it's only worth it to stay in that relationship as long as it's mutually beneficial.
  * Most developers change positions quickly.  If you've been in your current position for a year, start looking at what else is out there.
  * Workplace culture is critically important.

## Content Management Systems
* Content Management System - a website that is specifically designed to host a large amount of richly interconnected content.
* Content - material displayed on a site that is not HTML/CSS/Javascript
  * text based content like pages or blog posts
  * multimedia content like images or videos
  * frequently interwoven

## Why use a CMS?
* Allows non-developer users to make changes to the content of the site.  
* Provides a quick out-of-the-box framework to do common tasks, like post new pages on the site, search, tag content, simple web forms, etc.
* Ideal for organizations with large amounts of content or users
  * blogs
  * academic organizations (CNM is on a CMS)
  * brochure sites for large organizations with many user-facing pages
  * forums
  * intranets
* Development with CMSes is FAST

## How do CMSes work?
* Biggest ones are open source
  * You can download and hack on the code as you like
  * You have to maintain your site!
* User roles
  * Developers build a site and provide maintenance/improvements
  * Content admins write, edit, and publish the content on the site
  * Can break these user roles into a large number of different users
* pluggable code
  * Wordpress: Plugins and Themes
  * Drupal: Modules and Themes

## Common CMSes
https://w3techs.com/technologies/market/content_management
* Wordpress
  * 30% of the internet by # of sites
  * https://www.wpbeginner.com/showcase/40-most-notable-big-name-brands-that-are-using-wordpress/
  * wordpress.com vs wordpress site
  * tons of plugins and themes out there, many of which require purchase to unlock full functionality
  * plugins don't always play nicely with each other!
  * Wordpress market is in 
  * Custom Development
  * Selling pre-built plugins and themes
* Drupal
  * This is the one I used, so I'm biased
  * The most complex CMS based sites tend toward Drupal
  * Heavily in Government, Education, Nonprofit, and media
  * Obama white house site was on Drupal
  * Devs tend to get paid better than other CMS Devs
  * Most Drupal companies sell custom development/maintenance
  * Drupal focuses on community
  * not much here in ABQ :( 
  * Modules don't spam you, and tend to work well together
  * Code architecture in the contrib space is MUCH cleaner
* Joomla
  * Of the big three, Joomla is the middle ground for CMS - not so big and complex as Drupal, not so fragmented as Wordpress
  * Mostly has failed to differentiate itself
  * Has been declining for last six years
* Web-based CMSes
  * Squarespace, Wix, Shopify
  * Simplest, but give you the least control
  * Many small businesses start with these until they outgrow them
  * Fastest and easiest way for non-developer to throw together a site
* Proprietary CMSes
  * Specialized out-of-the-box solutions built and maintained by one company
  * Rarely open-source
  * Usually targeted at a very narrow slice of the market

## Myths about CMSes
* ~~CMSes are only for small sites~~
  * Some of the biggest sites out there run on CMSes
  * Most major news organizations, educational institutions, and governments are on a CMS
* ~~Developers who use CMSes don't write code~~
  * Although there are some developers who focus exclusively on configuring and building small sites, most developers in the space are maintaining their own code base.
* ~~I can create a project on a CMS and never think about it again~~
  * CMSes require security updates at a minimum
  * Content tends to get stale, so you need to keep updating it to keep engagement and SEO up
* ~~CMSes are insecure because they're open source~~
  * All major open-source CMSes regularly publish security updates
  * The open-source nature means that if you keep up with security updates, they have more developers than almost anybody else
