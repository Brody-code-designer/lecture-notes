# Other staff section
At Deep Dive orientation, before the instructor speaks, other staff will cover the following topics:
* Ice breaker
* Introduction of administrative staff and roles
* Slack expectations
* Professional Development curriculum
* Success plans
* Be respectful
* Code of conduct
* Additional Resources and requests for accommodation

# Instructor Section
This is what is traditionally led by the instructor at Deep Dive.

## Introduction
* Congratulations on prework!
* Bio (example)
  * I'm Paul Schulzetenberg, the Lead Instructor.  
  * Can call me Captain Paul
  * Bachelor's in CS, currently studying for MBA at UNM
  * I've been developing for 20 years, mostly building sites for clients
  * Have been with Deep Dive since February 2019
* Introduce assistants
* I will be away from the class until week 2
  * I'll deliver the first-day lecture to set expectations and introduce the bootcamp
  * On special assignment until then
  * I have been watching what you have been doing, and I'm looking forward to working with you
  * Both George and Marty have been lead instructor before, so you can trust whatever they say just as if I had said it.

## Virtual Learning Logistics
* All classes will happen on Zoom
  * Links to the lecture will be posted in the cohort channel
  * We will be recording the lecture, and if there are technical issues, you can request a link.
* Required to be available 8 - 5 M-Th, 8-3 F with 1 hour break at lunch.
* No in-person instruction or meetings in bootcamp spaces.
  * May be relaxed later, but I promise that all participants will be able to finish this bootcamp without ever needing to come in.
  * May request special accommodations for working at CNM locations, but there are no guarantees
    * Requires written documentation about why space or internet connection at your remote environment is insufficient

## Teaching/Learning Style
* Accountability: first you, then your peers, then instructors
* We're in this together
* Need to show drive
* All work must be your own
* Make plans for how you're going to work outside of class
* Most students spend 10-20 hours outside of class 
* Bring your laptop
* You have 2 cents.
  * We're always willing to hear your 2 cents
  * It's also only 2 cents -- we may ignore it.
    * Reasoning: We've done this a lot and it may not be obvious why we do something until later.  
    * Sometimes you'll have to trust us.

## Grading and Academic evaluations
* Tell them to read [the Syllabus](http://ddc-web-curriculum.cnm.edu/syllabus/) prior to Day 1 of class
* Capstone and PWP are most important
* Participation is a major part of your capstone grade, meaning that if you don't participate, you won't complete the bootcamp
* For grading, no news is good news
  * I will pull you aside for a conversation if I believe that you are not meeting the standards we expect.
  * If we haven't had that conversation, you can expect that you are doing well.


## Q&A
* Allow students to ask any questions
