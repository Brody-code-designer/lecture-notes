# Employer Roundtable and Graduation Ceremony Instructions

## Final Stand-up meeting 8:00 - 8:30
Special questions for final stand-up
1. What were you most nervous about coming into the bootcamp and how do you feel about it now?
2. What will you remember from the bootcamp?
3. What are you going to do next?

## Employer Roundtable 8:30 - 10:30
This is your chance to show off your capstone projects to local employers with an 10-12 minute presentation.  After your presentation, the employers will ask you questions.

### Topics for your presentation
**Every project is required to have a live demonstration and a slideshow.**  Beyond that, every project is different, so every presentation should be different as well.  Think about what makes your project unique, and how it can be best presented to a technical audience that has no idea what your application is for.

#### Required topics:
- Introduction of the team
- Who is your app for and why would they use it?
- Technical details
- Live demonstation of your project

#### Suggested additional topics:
- What makes your project different from other bootcamp projects?
- Fine-grained technical details such as
  - database design/ERD
  - data import complexity including massive scale of data or difficult data modeling
  - technologies used
  - Backend code demonstration
  - Frontend code demonstration
- Lessons learned/limitations of your approach  
- Next steps or future plans for the application

### Presentation Order
1. Aliengram
2. Plantr
3. Pollen

The presentations will be given via Zoom.  Esteban will coordinate the Zoom for the employer roundtable, so watch for details from him.

When the last group is done presenting, you will be dismissed from class until the graduation ceremony.

## Graduation Ceremony
* Deep Dive Team speeches
* Participant demos 
    * Each group: Shortened 5 minute presentation of capstone, followed by 30 second individual presentations of PWPs **We are strictly time limited so we will cut you off if you go too long.**
* Closing words

Presentation order will be the same as above.

The 5 minute presentation should be a shortened version of your employer roundtable presentation.  This is a less technical audience, so you should focus on the non-technical topics.

The 30 second presentation is a very brief introduction to your PWP.  Tell the audience what your site is, why you chose to make it, and any specific features you would like the audience to notice.

## What you need to do
* Figure out which group member will be screensharing.  Make sure that all PWPs and both versions of the presentation look good on their screen.
* Practice your 10-12 minute presentation for employers and be ready to answer questions.
* Practice your 5 minute version for graduation day.
* Practice a 30 second presentation on your PWP for graduation day.
